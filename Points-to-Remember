The Go Programming Language Specification

UTF-8 (upto 4 byte i.e. 32 bits) is a convenient way to store Unicode character. It stores unicode as binary.

A string literal represents a string constant obtained from concatenating a sequence of characters. There are two forms: raw string literals and interpreted string literals.
